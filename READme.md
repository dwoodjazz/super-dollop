## Douglas J Wood personal Website READme file:
<br />


> This project is suggested by the codecademy front end developer course and has been 
recommended to me by several senior developers.

> The project is simple in scope and will demonstrate the following skills:

+ badges
+ HTML
+ Markdown 
+ README files
+ javascript 
+ CSS styles
+ Git and GitHub 
+ command line and file navigation

### Additional skills include:
+ publishing to the web
+ Vue app framework

This static site will be simple, modern, sleek, and will use lots of whitespace. I want it to be a clean introduction to who I am and my current skills. I envision an H1 header, a profile pick, some slick but sparse background decoration, and a counter or some interactive element.
